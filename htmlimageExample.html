            <h1 class="mb-3">The Origin of Flower Names</h1>
            <p>Flower names originate from various sources, including Latin, Greek, and other languages. Many flower
                names botanical origins, derived from the plant's scientific name or descriptive features. For example,
                "Rosa" is derived from the Latin word for "rose," while "Dahlia" honors the Swedish botanist Andreas
                Dahl. Some flower names have mythological origins, such as "Iris," named after the Greek goddess of the
                rainbow. Others have historical or cultural significance, like "Lotus," which holds great importance in
                various Eastern cultures. Additionally, flower names can be derived from the names of people, as a way
                of honoring botanists, explorers, or other individuals who made significant contributions to the field
                of botany. The etymology and origin of each flower name may vary, adding depth and richness to the world
                of floral nomenclature.
